DevCon — Unit8 One-Page Conference

Instructions:
- Add a compressed hero video file at `Unit8/media/hero.mp4`. To keep initial page size < 500KB, compress and trim the video (short loop, low resolution, h.264 baseline).
- The site is ready for deployment to GitHub Pages: create a repo, push `Unit8` contents (or put at root), then enable Pages in repo settings.

Files of interest:
- `index.html` — the one-page site
- `scss/` — partials for variables, normalize, small/medium/large
- `css/styles.css` — compiled, minimal CSS
- `js/scripts.js` — hamburger toggle and read-more behavior

Accessibility & Validation Notes:
- Use the developer tools to test color contrast and run HTML/CSS validators.
- Replace the placeholder `media/hero.mp4` with a small compressed file before publishing.
